<p>The bufio package lets you create a buffered writer so you can work with a buffer in memory before writing it to disk. This is useful if you need to do a lot manipulation on the data before writing it to disk to save time from disk IO. It is also useful if you only write one byte at a time and want to store a large number in memory before dumping it to file at once, otherwise you would be performing disk IO for every byte. That puts wear and tear on your disk as well as slows down the process.</p>
