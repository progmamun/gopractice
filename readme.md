# Hands-On System Programming with Go

## Chapter 1,

- An Introduction to System Programming, introduces you to Go and
  system programming and provides some basic concepts and an overview of
  Unix and its resources, including the kernel API. It also defines many
  concepts that are used throughout the rest of the book.

## Chapter 2,

- Unix OS Components, focuses on the Unix operating system and the
  components that you will interact withâ€”files and the filesystem, processes,
  users and permissions, threads, and others. It also explains the various
  memory management techniques of the operating system, and how Unix
  handles resident and virtual memory.

## Chapter 3,

- An Overview of Go, takes a look at Go, starting with some history of
  the language and then explaining, one by one, all its basic concepts, starting with namespaces and the type system, variables, and flow control, and finishing with built-in functions and the concurrency model, while also
  offering an explanation of how Go interacts and manages its memory.

## Chapter 4,

- Working with the Filesystem, helps you to understand how the Unix
  filesystem works and how to master the Go standard library to handle file
  path operations, file reading, and file writing.

## Chapter 5,

- Handling Streams, helps you to learn about the interfaces for the
  input and output streams that Go uses to abstract data flows. It explains how they work and how to combine them and best use them without leaking
  information.

## Chapter 6,

- Building Pseudo-Terminals, helps you understand how a pseudoterminal application works and how to create one. The result will be an
  interactive application that uses standard streams just as the command line
  does.

## Chapter 7,

- Handling Processes and Daemons, provides an explanation of what
  processes are and how to handle them in Go, how to start child processes
  from a Go application, and how to create a command-line application that
  will stay in the background (a daemon) and interact with it.
  Chapter 8, Exit Codes, Signals, and Pipes, discusses Unix inter-process
  communication. It explains how to use exit codes effectively. It shows you
  how signals are handled by default inside an application, and how to manage
  them with some patterns for effective signal handling. Furthermore, it
  explains how to connect the output and input of different processes using
  pipes.

## Chapter 9,

- Network Programming, explains how to use a network to make
  processes communicate. It explains how network communication protocols
  work. It initially focuses on low-level socket communication, such as TCP
  and UDP, before moving on to web server development using the wellknown HTTP protocol. Finally, it shows how to use the Go template engine.

## Chapter 10,

- Data Encoding Using Go, explains how to leverage the Go
  standard library to encode complex data structures in order to facilitate
  process communications. It analyzes both text-based protocols, such as XML
  and JSON, and binary-based protocols, such as GOB.

## Chapter 11,

- Dealing with Channels and Goroutines, explains the basics of
  concurrency and channels and some general rules that prevent the creation of
  deadlocks and resource-leaking inside an application.

## Chapter 12,

- Synchronization with sync and atomic, discusses the
  synchronization packages of the sync and sync/atomic standard libraries, and
  how they can be used instead of channels to achieve concurrency easily. It
  also focuses on avoiding the leaking of resources and on recycling resources.

## Chapter 13,

- Coordination Using Context, discusses Context, a relatively new
  package introduced in Go that offers a simple way of handling asynchronous
  operations effectively.

## Chapter 14,

- Implementing Concurrency Patterns, uses the tools from the
  previous three chapters and demonstrates how to use and combine them to
  communicate effectively. It focuses on the most common patterns used in Go
  for concurrency.

## Chapter 15,

- Using Reflection, explains what reflection is and whether you
  should use it. It shows where it's used in the standard library and guides you in creating a practical example. It also shows how to avoid using reflection where there is no need to.

# Chapter 16,

- Using CGO, explains how CGO works and why and when you
  should use it. It explains how to use C code inside a Go application, and vice-versa.
